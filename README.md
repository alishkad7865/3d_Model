# Basic 3d Model using blender

## Objective

Learn and experiment with new 3d modeling and implementing them as recurring gif on my web browser using blender4web tool. Currently working on adding bones and moment in the models using blender 3.1 and finally importing that to my Unity Cart game.

## Blender installation

- Download blender from https://www.blender.org/download/
- edit the startup file and need to install/activate few pages from import packages like Rigify, and other tools
- please refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A&t=1681s for creating basic human structure
